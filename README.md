This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked bug in PHP: unexpected implicit return values. The bug occurs when a function doesn't explicitly return a value in all code paths and uses conditional returns. The solution shows a way to prevent this by explicitly returning a default value in all possible branches. Read the comments in the code for a detailed explanation.
